# How it was made
### Step 1:
- Firstly, I made ***ER Diagram*** to manage details in Database.

![DB Design](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dharmik0070/Global-Supermarket/master/Images/DB%20Design.png)
<br>
- Then chose ***MySQL*** database and created different tables to store and manage details.
- Included Primary and Foreign constraint accordingly.

### Step 2:
- Started working with more backend development, chose ***Python*** as a programming language and ***Python Flask*** as Server.
- Included all the basic modules to insert, update and delete products.

### Step 3:
- Started building User Interface, basic structure using ***HTML***.
- Then added Javascript to enable communication to backend via ***AJAX***, used ***jQuery***.

### Step 4:
- Added ***CSS*** to improve UI.
- Continued Step 2 backend development and started building ***APIs*** of each seperate functionalities.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dharmik0070/Global-Supermarket/master/Images/Backend%20Jsonify.png" alt="" width="100%" height="180">


### Step 5:
- Configured ***APIs*** communication in frontend using *Javascript* from Step 3.

![APIs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dharmik0070/Global-Supermarket/master/Images/APIs.png)


### Step 6:
- Improvised Data visualization in frontend by adding ***Dynamic JS***. E.g: Created Grid/Tables which gets populated based on querying in backend.
- Added fluidity to some components and made buttons more intuitive in UI (Frontend).

### Step 7:
- Tested each functionality thoroughly.
- Solved minor bugs (as most of them solved while developing).

<br>

## Challenges Faced

>It was great challenge for me to develop a ***Full-Stack*** application.But apart from it, there were many challenges I faced and it was really new learning, as I was new to some topics.
- <b>Database</b>
  - Like many developers, initially I faced issues in constraint management, like setting up foriegn keys in many-to-many relationship.
- <b>Backend</b>
  - Faced issue in configuring ***Edit*** button, where I'd to work with fetching and posting data at same time, in *Manage Product Page*. (Backend development was quite strong compare to frontend devlopment)
- <b>Frontend</b>
  - As I know *jQuery* a bit during developing this project, faced issues to configure button with some ***APIs*** and calling the same.
  - Also initially faced an issue in <b>jsonifying</b> frontend data to be send.
  - Faced an issue in filling up ***Edit*** Dialog box with previously entered values in *Manage Product Page*.
  - I have ***not focused on UI part much***, but faced minor issues in margin-padding like usual.
<br>

> But it was great brain-stroming and new learning to solve each issue thoroughly, it has really boosted my confidence.
